# reactAppOnRuntime
 

> The render method takes two arguments:

1. The HTML-like elements (a.k.a. JSX) you want to output

2. The location in the DOM where React will render the JSX into

Hereâ€™s what our render method looks like:

__Example:__
```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Sherlock Holmes</h1>,
  document.body
);
```
